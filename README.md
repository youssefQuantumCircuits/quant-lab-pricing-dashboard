# üß† Quant Lab: Neural Network Option Pricing Dashboard

This project is a live, real-time **option pricing dashboard** powered by machine learning. It pulls current market data via Yahoo Finance, processes features like moneyness and time to expiry, and uses a trained **neural network model** to estimate theoretical option prices.

## üöÄ Features

- Fetches live option chains (calls and puts)
- Trains a neural network on real-world option data
- Predicts and compares market vs model prices
- Visualizes prediction performance
- Deployable via Streamlit Cloud
